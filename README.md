## Overview
Our goal is to provide a worry-free experience for users of all ages, allowing them to watch videos and listen to music without exposure to inappropriate content. To achieve this, we have developed a separate, enterprise-grade parental control system designed to address the gaps where many existing music and video platforms fall short.

<b>This project is currently in its first conceptual stage. We welcome community support and donations to help further develop and strengthen the parental control engine.<b>

ZimbaBeats is a purpose-built Android application designed to provide children with a safe, advertisement-free YouTube viewing experience. The application operates in conjunction with the ZimbaBeats Family companion application, enabling parents and guardians to maintain comprehensive oversight and control of their children's media consumption.

The application is built using modern Android development practices, including Jetpack Compose for the user interface and Material Design 3 for visual consistency. All streaming functionality operates without advertisements or tracking mechanisms.
